  @javascript @_file_upload
  Scenario: See the list of students without uploaded files in the openbook resource folder
    When I am on the "Openbook resource folder" "mod_openbook > Submissions" page logged in as teacher1
    And I set the field "Filter" to "No file submission"
    Then I should see "Student 1"
    But I should not see "Currently there are no files available or not yet published."
