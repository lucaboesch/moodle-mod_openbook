Description
-----------

This plugin is primarily designed to allow students to upload files for later access, for instance during an exam.
Teachers have the ability to aprove documents manually, or documents can be automatically aproved.
Teachers can choose if files can be shared between students. They can also chose if student sharing aproval is needed or automatic.

Usage
-------

A possible teaching scenario could look like this: 

* A teacher opens the Private Student Folder activity for submission. He chooses if submissions are aproved automatically. He also chooses if submissions are private (cannot be shared between students), can be shared between students (with student aproval) or are shared automatically.

* Students submit documents during the submission period. They also choose wether if they want to share the documents with peers or not (if sharing and student approval are enabled).

* Once submission period ends
  * Teacher aproves documents (if needed).
  * Students can access (download) uploaded documents.


Installation
------------

* Copy the module code directly to the mod/privatestudentfolder directory.
* Log into Moodle as administrator.
* Open the administration area (http://your-moodle-site/admin) to start the installation automatically.


Privacy API
--------------

The plugin fully implements the Moodle Privacy API.
